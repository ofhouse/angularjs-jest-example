# Angular.js with Jest example

This is a proof-of-concept project to build a concept for testing [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) with [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Getting started

Before you start make sure that you run `yarn` to install all required dependencies.

- `yarn start`

  Starts a webpack-dev-server for developing the application.

- `yarn test`

  Runs the tests with jest.

## Constraints

Since this is a proof-of-concept for an much bigger application, there are some constraints which are transferred from the bigger app to this example:

- `angular` has to be available as global variable
- `moment` has to be available as global variable
- Templates are external `.html`-modules which are imported by webpack
